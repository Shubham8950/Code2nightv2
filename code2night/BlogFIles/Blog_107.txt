<p><h3><b>Issue-</b></h3><p>So , while working with <b>.Net core</b> you often need to read app json file from siteroot to access connection string and other keys available there. So in previous versions we used to use <b>Configuration Builder</b> for reading json file using <b>SetBasePath</b> Method.We used to write</p><pre>new ConfigurationBuilder().SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()).AddJsonFile("appSettings.json").Build();</pre><p>But the same code becomes non reachable when it comes to .Net core as&nbsp; you receive error which is shown in below image saying&nbsp;'ConfigurationBuilder' does not contain a definition for 'SetBasePath' . So will see how to make this work in .Net core 3.1.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>So, This issue is basically because of a missing package in .Net core 3. So for this you have to add&nbsp;<b>Microsoft.Extension.Configuration.json </b>in your project. You can find this package on <b>Nuget</b> package as shown in image.</p>

<p><br></p><p>You can also install this package using Package Manager console using this command. For more reference you can have a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json</a><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json"></a>&nbsp;and then have a look at installation steps.</p><pre>Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json -Version 5.0.0</pre><p>So , after you successfully install this package you can check <b>SetBasePath </b>method will start working as expected. You can have a look at below image.</p>
<img src="/Uploads/setpath20210303095554.PNG"><br><p></p></p><p>So ,you can follow the steps and this is how you can read <b>app.json</b> file in .Net core 3.1.&nbsp;</p>
